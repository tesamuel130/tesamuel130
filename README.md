## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Samuel Tesfaye from Ethiopia, and I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a deep passion for building scalable web and mobile applications. With over 3 years of experience, I truly enjoy learning new languages and frameworks, such as React, Next.js, and React Native. I am continuously exploring new tools and technologies to stay at the forefront of the industry.
